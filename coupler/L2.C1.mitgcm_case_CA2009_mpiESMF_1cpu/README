code: 
  coupled MITgcm--ESMF code with MPI, use 1 CPUs
  the MITgcm solver is divided into "init", "run", "finalize" parts
  ESMF drives different parts

simulation:
  California region
  should have same results as stand-alone MITgcm code

Notes:
To install and run this case::

./install.sh
cd mitRun
./Allrun

To clean this case::

./clean.sh

Folders:
  ./mitCode: The MITgcm code folder.
  ./mitRun: The simulation will run in this folder.
  ./utils: The install scripts for MITgcm. When using another computer, the addresses in the scripts should be updated.

WARNING!!!WARNING!!!
####################
The MITgcm source file should be in '../../MITgcm_c66h/' to run this case.
The ESMF should be installed in '../../esmf/' to run this case.
In install.sh, the MPI_HOME variable is "/project_shared/Libraries/openmpi-2.1.1_pgi_fortran_17.5-0/include"
