ESMF-MITgcm interface implementation test

This folder contains an ESMF-MITgcm coupled test case. The case aims to test
the implementation of ESMF-MITgcm interface. In this test, the ESMF driver will
drive MITgcm. The MITgcm solver is divided into "init", "run", "finalize"
parts. The ESMF-atmosphere interface is also implemented, but the functions do
not drive "real" atmosphere model. 

This test uses 1 CPU.

simulation:
  California region
  The results should be the same as stand-alone MITgcm code

To install and run this case::

./install.sh
cd mitRun
./Allrun

To clean this case::

./clean.sh

Folders:
  ./mitRun: The simulation will run in this folder.
  ./mitCode: A few updates of MITgcm source code.
  ./utils: Install scripts for MITgcm.

The MITgcm path is defined as '/home/rus043/scripps_kaust_model_github/MITgcm_c67m' in install.sh
The MPI_HOME path is defined as '/project_shared/Libraries/openmpi-2.1.1_pgi_fortran_17.5-0/include' in install.sh

The ESMF should be installed to run this case. The variable ESMFMKFILE should
be defined:

  export ESMFMKFILE=$ESMF_DIR/lib/libg/Linux.pgi.64.openmpi.default/esmf.mk

where ESMF_DIR should be the location that ESMF is installed.
