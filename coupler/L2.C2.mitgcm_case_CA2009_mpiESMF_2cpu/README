code: 
  coupled MITgcm--ESMF code with MPI, use 2 CPUs
  the MITgcm solver is divided into "init", "run", "finalize" parts
  ESMF drives different parts
  based on the L2C1 case, with update patches

simulation:
  California region
  should have same results as stand-alone MITgcm code

Notes:
To install and run this case::

./install.sh
cd mitRun
./Allrun

To clean this case::

./clean.sh

Folders:
  ./patches: The patches to be update from the 1 CPU case.
  ./mitRun: The simulation will run in this folder.
